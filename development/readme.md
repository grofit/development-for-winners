# Development

This is probably one of the larger sections as it will deal with design patterns, discussions into why certain approaches are better than others as well as specific techniques such as **dependency injection** and ways to manage large architectures.

It is divided up into:

- General (Stuff that will be useful in both web and game dev worlds)
- Web (Stuff that is probably more useful for doing web dev)
- Game Dev (I think you get the pattern emerging here)

> You may just want to dive into game dev stuff without looking into the web world, but there are some brilliant patterns that originated in the web/app world and have made their way into the game world and with the web world starting to allow more realtime apps via canvas and WASM it is going to mean game dev will meld more into the web world too. Ultimately I would read everything, but its your call soldier.

As this book is around knowledge sharing I would follow it through from general -> web -> game dev, only because a lot of techniques are simpler to learn in the context of the web world, then just translate that knowledge into the game dev world, like **mvvm** is easier to learn in the context of the web world in my opinion, and then can easily be translated into the game dev world, but we will try to cover it in both worlds so you get a fuller understanding and see how implementations can differ.
